For some reason the online version is quite laggy - maybe because its hosted on Github. The local version works fine.

## About the project  
A demo game build in WebGL (using library Three.js) by Klemen Červ (klemen.cerv@gmail.com), Denis Kotnik (denis.kotnik@gmail.com), Aljaž Kozina (kozinc@gmail.com) and Kristian Žarn (kristian.zarn@gmail.com). If you want to use the code: it's fine by me, but please ask the rest of the team.

## Run the game
Just open **index.html** file.
